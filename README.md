# Trent Thomas's Repository for ESS 569

Taught Autumn 2024 by Professor Marine Denolle at the University of Washington

## How to install this repository

First, clone this repository from github.

`git clone https://github.com/UW-MLGEO/TrentThomas.git`

In order to run the Jupyter notebook, we need a python installation with the numpy, matplotlib, and jupyter libraries. If you already have a python environment with those libraries, you're good to go. If you don't, use the conda instructions below to create the necessary environment.

`conda create --name <env_name> numpy matplotlib jupyterlab notebook`

Now you can activate this environment and explore the repository with whatever code editor you like (e.g., jupyter notebook, VS Code). The main notebook is found under

`main_notebook.ipynb`

## My favorite Earth science topics

I am generally interested in how the surface environment, atmosphere, and geochemistry of planets change over time. I typically approach these problems by building theoretical computer simulations and comparing them to data from sources such as planetary rovers, telescopes, or laboratory measurements. I've worked on projects addressing the evolution of Mars's atmosphere, characterization of the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets, and the global freezing of Earth in the distant past.

## Glossary term
