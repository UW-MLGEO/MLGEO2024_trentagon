# Trent Thomas's Repository for ESS 569
Taught Autumn 2024 by Professor Marine Denolle at the University of Washington

## How to install this repository

First, clone this repository from github.

`git clone https://github.com/UW-MLGEO/TrentThomas.git`

In order to run the Jupyter notebook, we need a python installation with the numpy, matplotlib, and jupyter libraries. If you already have a python environment with those libraries, you're good to go. If you don't, use the conda instructions below to create the necessary environment.

`conda create --name <env_name> numpy matplotlib jupyterlab notebook`

Now you can activate this environment and explore the repository with whatever code editor you like (e.g., jupyter notebook, VS Code). The main notebook is found under

`main_notebook.ipynb`
